# Excel-Search
A search engine powered by Microsoft Excel

Before using this program, please make sure that the excel worksheets you wish to search are copied and pasted here.

After you have clicked the <Fetch files> button, a list of available excel files would be shown in column F. If you wish to search only some of those files, please delete their filenames from column F, then press <Delete some> to verify.





If you wish to search a particular keyword, please type the keyword in cell C10 and press the <Search keyword> function. After that, the program would copy every row containing that keyword to a new worksheet.

If you wish to search another keyword, please delete the search result by pressing the <Delete result> button or change the new worksheet's name.

If you wish to search for more than one keyword, please enter the list of keywords, each separated by a space, into cell C17. After that, there are two functions available: the <AND search> button, which copies all rows containing all keywords in any order, and the <OR search> button, which copies all rows containing at least one keyword.





To delete reset this workbook, press the <Delete all> button.
